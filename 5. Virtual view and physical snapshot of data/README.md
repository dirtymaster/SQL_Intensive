Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also `person_visits` table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by `person_id` column and your final SQL please present in `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) to be honest, the definition “symmetric union” doesn’t exist in Set Theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference. 

## Exercise 05 - Let’s calculate a discount price for each person

Please create a Database View `v_price_with_discount` that returns a person's orders with person names, pizza names, real price and calculated column `discount_price` (with applied 10% discount and satisfies formula `price - price*0.1`). The result please sort by person name and pizza name and make a round for `discount_price` column to integer type. Please take a look at a sample result below.


| name |  pizza_name | price | discount_price |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Andrey | cheese pizza | 800 | 720 | 
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | 1100 | 990 |

Please create a Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` (with data included) based on SQL statement that finds the name of pizzeria Dmitriy visited on January 8, 2022 and could eat pizzas for less than 800 rubles (this SQL you can find out at Day #02 Exercise #07). 

To check yourself you can write SQL to Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` and compare results with your previous query.

Let's refresh data in our Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` from exercise #06. Before this action, please generate one more Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of Materialized View except pizzeria that we can see in a result from exercise #06.
After adding a new visit please refresh a state of data for `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats`.

After all our exercises were born a few Virtual Tables and one Materialized View. Let’s drop them!
