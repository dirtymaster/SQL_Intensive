## _Isolation is one of ACID properties_

Resume: Today you will see how database works with transactions and isolation levels

## Exercise 00 - Simple transaction

| Exercise 00: Simple transaction |                                                                                                                          |

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Please provide a proof that your parallel session can’t see your changes until you will make a `COMMIT`;

Take a look at the steps below.

**Session #1**
- update of rating for “Pizza Hut” to 5 points in a transaction mode .
- check that you can see a changes in session #1

**Session #2**
- check that you can’t see a changes in session #2

**Session #1**
- publish your changes for all parallel sessions.

**Session #2**
- check that you can see a changes in session #2


So, take a look on example of my output for Session #2.

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |    4.6
    (1 row)

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |      5
    (1 row)

You can see the same query returns different results, because the first one was run before publishing in Session#1 and the second one was queried after finished Session#1.

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Before a task, make sure you are at a default isolation level in your database. Just run the next statement

`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL;`

and the result should be “read committed”;

If not, then please set “read committed” isolation level explicitly on a session level.

Please check a rating for “Pizza Hut” in a transaction mode for both Sessions and after that make `UPDATE` of rating to 4 value in session #1 and make `UPDATE` of rating to 3.6 value in session #2 (in the same order as in the picture).

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Let’s reproduce a deadlock situation in our database.

| ------ | ------ |
| You can see a graphical presentation of the deadlock situation on a picture. Looks like a “christ-lock” between parallel sessions. | ![D08_12](misc/images/D08_12.png) |

Please write any SQL statement with any isolation level (you can use default setting) on the `pizzeria` table to reproduce this deadlock situation.
