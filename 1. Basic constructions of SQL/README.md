## _Relational Data Model and SQL_

Resume: Today you will see how relational model works and how to get needed data based on basic constructions of  SQL

- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community).

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Let’s apply data intervals for the `person` table. 
Please make a SQL statement which returns a person's identifiers, person's names and interval of person’s ages (set a name of a new calculated column as ‘interval_info’) based on pseudo code below. 

    if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
    else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
    else return 'interval #3'

and yes...please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

Please make a select statement that returns person names and pizzeria names based on the `person_visit` table with date of visit in a period from 07th of January to 09th of January 2022 (including all days) (based on internal query in `FROM` clause) .


Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause
    ORDER BY ...

Please add a ordering clause by person name in ascending mode and by pizzeria name in descending mode
